Annasamrakshna is an application to reduce food wastage by bridging the gap between food donors and those in need. It allows individuals, restaurants, or organizations with surplus food to donate it conveniently. Donors can provide details such as the type of food, quantity, location, and expiration date through a user-friendly interface. Simultaneously, NGOs or charitable organizations can register on the platform to access donation details and coordinate food collection. The system promotes efficient distribution by providing visibility into available food resources, helping to combat hunger while reducing environmental harm caused by food waste
